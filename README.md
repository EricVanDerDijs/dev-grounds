### A great place to know people and organize fun coding related activities!

Personal Node.js Web Application Project to practice my node knowedge, it was built with:

- Node.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Express.js
- EJS
- Bootstrap4 
- Passport.js

It has a little bit more of work to be done, would like to add:

- Image Storage
- Promises or Async/Await
